IoT Vulnerability Scanner
Overview

The IoT Vulnerability Scanner is a comprehensive tool designed to identify, assess, and report vulnerabilities within IoT networks. Built with Streamlit, this scanner leverages multiple modules to scan networks, identify connected devices, match known vulnerabilities, detect potential data leaks, and assess Wi-Fi security. The tool aims to enhance the security posture of IoT networks by providing actionable insights and detailed reports on vulnerabilities.
Features

    Network Scanning: Detect and map devices on the network.
    Device Identification: Recognize various IoT devices using fingerprints.
    Vulnerability Matching: Identify known vulnerabilities associated with the detected devices.
    Data Leak Detection: Check for potential data leaks within the network.
    Wi-Fi Security Assessment: Analyze Wi-Fi security settings and configurations.
    Comprehensive Reporting: Generate detailed reports summarizing vulnerabilities and providing recommendations.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
```
    Python 3.8 or higher
    pip (Python package installer)
    Git (optional, for cloning the repository)
```

Installation

    Clone the repository (if hosted on a version control system like GitHub):

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd IoT-Vulnerability-Scanner
```

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application:

```

    streamlit run main.py
```

Configuration

    Place any additional data files (e.g., fingerprints, vulnerability databases) in the data/ directory.
    Modify configuration files as needed for your specific environment.

Usage

    Launch the Application:
        The Streamlit interface will open in your default web browser.
        Navigate through the different pages to perform network scans, vulnerability assessments, and view reports.

    Scanning a Network:
        Use the Network Scanning page to initiate a scan of the local network.
        Identified devices will be displayed along with their details.

    Vulnerability Matching:
        After identifying devices, use the Vulnerability Matching page to cross-reference detected devices with known vulnerabilities.

    Generating Reports:
        After scans and assessments, generate a report summarizing findings and recommendations.
